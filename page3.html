	<h1>Boigraphy and Roadmap</h1>
	
	<h2>A bit of me</h2>
	<p>I'm Ronald Colata, my friend call me Ron, will aside from i'm a little bit old just kidding im only 33 for me that's still young. <br>
	will i have a lot of plan in life but i know i dont have all the time in the world so i choose my priority and one of that is to finish college <br>
	i really want to be a pilot but my pocket can't handle that.<br><br>
	On my free time i go on a road trip with my bike(motorcycle) just to shake the stress and to reset my self so i can face again the reality of my life.<br>
	Will i am a very outgoing person i laugh a lot and make fun of my close friends "maluko". I'm the eldest child of my parent and they are my <br>
	azinspiration why im striving and making plans.
	</p>
	<p>My first year in college are the hardest part because it came to my mind that i should be here because i'm way older to my classmate and it's not easy to adjust,<br> but thanks to them they accept me like i'm young like them...</p>


	<h2>My Roadmap</h2>

	<p>Aside to finish this study, i want to focus on being a Web Developer even if i have a lot of interest. The only key to reach that is to focus on my <br>
	study that's why im doing all i can. I do my own studies on things that might help me to become what i want.</p>
