	<h1>My Thoughts and Plan</h1>

	<h2> My thoughts on Web Application Architecture</h2>
	<p>as a student of Web Application Architecture we should learn to make a good and functioning web application for clients and businesses, and inline with this we have to learn the flow of creating a good web application, <br>
		how to effectively design its flow and architecture according to the needs of the client and its GUI should fit the capabilities or knowledge of the user by creating user-friendly interface and easy to maintain system to <br>
		avoid operation stoppage  of the client's process.
	 </p>

	 <h2>Client Side or Server Side?</h2>

	 <p>Will if my brain can handle i choose both. But i am more interested in Server Side even if it's hard and complicated because not like on Client side they can see your work as the GUI, in Server side as long as the system can give its purpose and run properly they don't care how you code it. So i will choose Server Side because im not that artistic.</p>
